        Set up the client.

        If address is None, then we will scan to find the first CoolLEDX device
        (nondeterministic if multiple devices are present).  So if you only have one
        CoolLEDX device (within bluetooth range), then you don't need to
        supply an address.  If you have multiple devices, you should supply an address.

        The connection timeout is the timeout used during the connection process (both
        for the scan, and for the connection itself).  The command timeout is the
        timeout used when waiting for a notification from the device after sending a
        command.

        Connection retries is the number of full reattempts to make.  In my experience,
        sometimes you'll not find the sign advertising, sometimes you'll get another
        error.  I was always able to connect within 4 retries, but we default to 5 for
        safety.  This DOES mean that it'll spin for a while if there's no sign around.
