- When writing tests, only use pytest or pytest plugins; do not use unittest
- All tests should have typing annotations
- All tests should be in ./tests.  Be sure to create all necessary files and folders.
- When creating tests, create an init.py file if one does not exist
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions
