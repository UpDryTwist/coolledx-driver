type: auto

- Provide detailed documentation using docstrings and README files
- Every class should have a dockstring; every function should have a docstring
- Add typing annotations to every function and class.  Be sure to include return type annotations when necessary.  Use typing hints compatible with Python 3.12+.
- Always keep any comments that already exist in the file - if the comments are no longer appropriate, flag the comment for review by inserting the text 'REVIEW-THIS ' at the front of the comment.
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects
- Document environment setup
