# CoolLEDX Driver

This package implements a Python driver for the CoolLEDX LED strips (i.e., those strips
that are controlled by the CoolLED1248 app). The strips receive commands via Bluetooth,
and can generally be programmed to display text (which is actually just a rendered image
of the text), images, or animations. You can get these strips pretty cheaply on
AliExpress
-- just be sure that you see a picture of the CoolLED1248 app on the product page, as
this
driver won't work with any other sort of strip. That said, they're pretty ubiquitous, at
least at the time of this writing (December 2023).

## Usage

You need to have a functioning Bluetooth device. This package
uses [Bleak](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak)
for all its Bluetooth interactions, so you should be able to use any system supported
by Bleak . . . but it hasn't been tested on anything other than Windows 11 (and soon
Ubuntu on a Pi).

### Using a container

You can build a Docker container to run this. Build using "make docker-build".

Running the container as of this moment will run tweak_sign.py (ultimately, I'll
be modifying it to start a service, listening on a message queue). Pass the parameters
to tweak_sign.py as you would if you were running it from the command line.

You can use the utility scripts in the docker_scripts folder to run the container
and call the utility functions appropriately.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Write some bare-bones documentation, at least
* [ ] Ensure this is tested out on a Raspberry Pi (my end target device)
* [ ] Add a simple REST listener app to allow driving this remotely

## Credits and Sources

#### Main Kudos

This project could not possibly exist without the work done
by [CrimsonClyde](https://git.team23.org/CrimsonClyde)
in reverse engineering the CoolLEDX protocol
at [LED FaceShields](https://git.team23.org/CrimsonClyde/led-faceshields). Much
of the code in this project is directly derived from that code, and almost all of the
insights were from that work. That repository has a bunch of useful information about
the underlying protocol.

#### The Source?

I believe that these LEDs are made
by [Juntong Technology](http://www.jotus-tech.com/en/). I think that
the app itself is made by some 3rd party. I sent an email to the contact at Juntong, but
never got a reply, so not sure. If anyone has a contact, I'd love to get connected, as I
really like their strips!

For source code related to the app, which was helpful in some questions I had about
the protocol (but, honestly, not too much there, and a headache to read), you could try:

* [iOS App (Crosby) Source](https://gitee.com/juntong-iOS/CROSBY_Combine/blob/master/CROSBY_Combine/Classess/Tools/BluetoothManager.m)
* [Some other source that seems to poke the device](https://gitee.com/ifdef/WxBLETools/blob/master/utils/ble.js)

#### Sniffing the CoolLED1248 App

For some of my protocol analysis, I found it useful to do the following:

* Turn on BLE logging on my Android phone (under developer options) to save a log
  capture.
  Be sure to turn it on right before you start the capture, then turn it off
  immediately,
  so that you're not collecting a ton of junk information.
* Run the CoolLED1248 app and send commands to the LED strip
* Pull the log file from the phone to my PC using the ADB interface
* Analyze it with Wireshark (just put a filter on the MAC address of the LED strip)

This helped me get over some spots where I was a bit lost in the handshakes, or making
some bad assumptions about what was or was not working.

## Panel Communication

CoolLED1248<br>
Versions 2.x of the Android app can import and export JT files. If you have problems
importing or with other functions, try version 2.1.4.

### PC Image / Animation Creation

If you want to use your PC to create .jt files, check out the JT-Edit repository:
https://github.com/auc0le/JT-Edit

### CoolLEDX Driver Installation

To install the CoolLEDX driver on your system:<br>

1. clone the repository to your PC.<br>

       git clone https://github.com/UpDryTwist/coolledx-driver.git

2. From the coolledx-driver folder, copy the coolledx folder to your python library

       cd /yourpath/coolledx-driver/
       cp -a coolledx /home/<yourusername>/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/.

3. Install bleak

       pip install bleak

4. If you get this error when trying to run commands from the coolledx driver,

       ImportError: cannot import name 'StrEnum' from 'enum' (/usr/lib/python3.8/enum.py)

   install StrEnum and edit the coolledx/__init__.py file so StrEnum is imported from
   strenum instead of enum

       python3 -m pip install StrEnum

   <pre>
   #---then edit the first few lines of coolledx/__init__.py file----
   #from enum import IntEnum, StrEnum
   from enum import IntEnum
   from strenum import StrEnum
   #-----------------------------------------------------------------
   </pre>

<b>To send commands to the panel:</b>

1. Change to the coolledx-driver directory and use scan.py to find your MAC address.

       python3 utils/scan.py
   <pre>
   --response---
   Scanning for 10.0 seconds (change duration with -t) . . .
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Device: CoolLEDX (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX), RSSI: -61
   Height: 16, Width: 32
   </pre>

2. Use utils/tweak_sign.py to send commands to the panel.

       python3 utils/tweak_sign.py x
   <pre>
   --response---
   usage: tweak_sign.py [-h] [-a [ADDRESS]] [-t TEXT] [-s SPEED] [-b BRIGHTNESS] [-c COLOR]
                    [-C BACKGROUND_COLOR] [-j START_COLOR_MARKER] [-k END_COLOR_MARKER] [-f FONT]
                    [-H FONT_HEIGHT] [-l LOG] [-o ONOFF] [-m MODE] [-i IMAGE] [-n ANIMATION]
                    [-N ANIMATION_SPEED] [-w WIDTH_TREATMENT] [-g HEIGHT_TREATMENT]
                    [-z HORIZONTAL_ALIGNMENT] [-y VERTICAL_ALIGNMENT] [-jt JTFILE]
   tweak_sign.py: error: unrecognized arguments: xxx
   </pre>

<b>To send an image to the panel:</b>

        python3 utils/tweak_sign.py -a YOUR:MAC:FROM:SCAN:PY -i yourimage.png

<b>To send a JT file to the panel:</b>

        python3 utils/tweak_sign.py -a YOUR:MAC:FROM:SCAN:PY -jt myjtfile.jt
