globs: /**/*.py
alwaysApply: false
---
- Enforce code consistency style using Ruff.  Use Poetry to run Ruff after all changes.
- Check coding style against the checks specified in .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Prefer using classes to independent functions, unless there is a strong overriding reason to use a function
- Use isort for import sorting
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions:
  - snake_case for functions and variables
  - PascalCase for classes
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
- Maximum line length of 88 characters
- Use absolute imports over relative imports
