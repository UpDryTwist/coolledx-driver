- Implement robust error handling and logging, including context capture
- Assume that the default run state of the application in production is logging level INFO
- Include assertions wherever possible to validate assumptions and catch potential errors early.
- Create custom exception classes
- Use proper try-except blocks
- Handle edge cases properly
- Use proper error messages
